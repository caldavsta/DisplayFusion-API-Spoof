# DisplayFusion-API-Spoof
Want to create DisplayFusion scripts in Visual Studio, but there's no intellisense for DF's built-in functions? Look no further.

## Instructions

1. Save this repo somewhere
2. Add this project to your VS solution (as existing project)
3. Add that project to your DisplayFusion project as a Shared Project

Now all you have to do is copy + paste your code into a file called DisplayFusionFunction.cs
