# DisplayFusionIntelliSense
Want to create DisplayFusion scripts in Visual Studio, but there's no intellisense for DF's built-in functions? Look no further.

## Setting up Visual Studio to start working on a DF script

1. Save this repo somewhere
2. Add the BFS.shproj file as existing project to a new VS solution 
3. Create a new C# project in your solution
4. Add a reference to your new project -> the reference
should point to the shared project.
5. Just copy and paste your code directly from DF into your new project

The workflow is that you just copy+paste the whole code file into DF when you're ready to run it.
